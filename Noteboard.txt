Tab1=Thanks for checking out Noteboard. It's a notepad built into Rainmeter. There are five tabs that can store your text.#CRLF##CRLF#It also supports multiline text! You can copy & paste text with multiple lines and add your own by using `ctrl+enter`.#CRLF##CRLF#Simply click on the text to start editting and hit enter to save. If you don't want to save any edits, simply hit 'esc' or click off of the text. You can copy the text of your current tab by 'middle-clicking' on the text area, it will get copied to your clipboard.
Tab2=It should be easy to edit some basic settings in this meter. The size, color, font, and a few other options are available for easy editing in the 'settings.inc' file included with the skin.#CRLF##CRLF#Feel free to do any editing to fit this to your setup, I hope you get something cool!
Tab3=It supports basic text and symbols:#CRLF##CRLF#Examples of symbols: ¿ ¦ Æ#CRLF##CRLF#Sorry, nothing too crazy for your ASCII art... you'll likely end up with a '?' if a more advanced symbol isn't converted.
Tab4=Sorry, I know its not perfect here are somethings currently a little goofy to keep in mind.#CRLF##CRLF#The CONS:#CRLF##CRLF#- Dependent upon Rainmeter's InputText plugin. This means that ctrl+enter is not easy to change within a skin. You would have to edit the plugin itself and a skin simply can't do that (for good reason).#CRLF##CRLF#- Not all ASCII symbols will transfer, more advanced ones will show up as a '?' or a block. This is something that would require a lot of conversion within the .lua file. I'm not aware of a framework that would handle the amounts of symbols out there.#CRLF##CRLF#- I currently do not have a setup to convert double quotes in the .lua file properly. This means that double quotes WILL BREAK THE TAB. You will have to go into the Noteboard.txt file and delete the quotes on the relative line/tab before the tab is editable again. Sorry!#CRLF##CRLF#- I currently do not have the text fields disappear when you enter an editted tab. This means that if you want transparency DURING editing you will have to add the capability to hide the current tab... otherwise the current text will be viewable through the transparent edit layer.
Tab5=Things To Do:#CRLF##CRLF#- Correctly hide the text field when an edit field is up so the noteboard can use transparency appropriately while editing text.#CRLF##CRLF#- Add .lua conversions for double quotes using <single quote><double quotes><single quotes> to escape them and apply conversions them appropriately. This will allow for double quotes to be utilized without breaking the tab.#CRLF##CRLF#- If possible, write up instructions to edit InputText plugin to switch betwen 'Enter' creating a new line and 'ctrl+enter' to submit a new line (or have a save button).#CRLF##CRLF#This is a very small side project so I wouldn't expect these, but if I find the time I will.
